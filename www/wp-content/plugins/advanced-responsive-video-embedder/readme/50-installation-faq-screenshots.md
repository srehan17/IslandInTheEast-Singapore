### How to get the pro version working? ###

1. Go though the purchase process on [nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/](https://nextgenthemes.com/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/)
1. Follow the 3 easy steps you get with the purchase receipt. It is basically downloading a arve-pro.zip and installing it through your WordPress Admin panel.

### Why are my videos not filling their container? ###

You are most likely use `align`, this plugin has a option for limiting video width with alignment. If you want your videos to fill their containers then you should not use the `align` shortcode attribute. This assumes that you left the 'Video Maximal Width' field on the options page empty.

### Can you add a video provider? ###

I have no plans on implementing providers that include videos via JavaScript such as www.nicovideo.jp. I also will not implement video services from mainstream media news organizations. For others, feel free to ask.

### How do I embed videos from a unlisted providers / iframes? ###

This plugin not changes anything to usual HTML `<iframe>` embed codes you have to use the shortcode creator dialog and paste iframe embed codes there or write them manually. They will become `[arve url="https://..."]`. The url represents what is the `src` in HTML embeds. It works as simple as this, if the [arve] shortcode does not detect a known URL structure then it will treat the URL as a `src` for the iframe.

### Why does my YouTube video not repeat/loop? ###

This plugins embed is considered as 'custom player' by YouTube so you have to pass the video ID as playlist parameters to make the loop work.

`[arve url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvRqvX413Ik" parameters="loop=1&playlist=pvRqvX413Ik"]`
