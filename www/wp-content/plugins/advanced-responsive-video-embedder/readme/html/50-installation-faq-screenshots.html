<h3>Why are my videos not filling their container?</h3>

<p>You are most likely use <code>align</code>, this plugin has a option for limiting video width with alignment. If you want your videos to fill their containers then you should not use the <code>align</code> shortcode attribute. This assumes that you left the 'Video Maximal Width' field on the options page empty.</p>

<h3>Can you add a video provider?</h3>

<p>I have no plans on implementing providers that include videos via JavaScript such as www.nicovideo.jp. I also will not implement video services from mainstream media news organizations. For others, feel free to ask.</p>

<h3>How do I embed videos from a unlisted providers / iframes?</h3>

<p>This plugin not changes anything to usual HTML <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> embed codes you have to use the shortcode creator dialog and paste iframe embed codes there or write them manually. They will become <code>[arve url="https://..."]</code>. The url represents what is the <code>src</code> in HTML embeds. It works as simple as this, if the [arve] shortcode does not detect a known URL structure then it will treat the URL as a <code>src</code> for the iframe.</p>

<h3>Why does my YouTube video not repeat/loop?</h3>

<p>This plugins embed is considered as 'custom player' by YouTube so you have to pass the video ID as playlist parameters to make the loop work.</p>

<p><code>[arve url="<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvRqvX413Ik'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvRqvX413Ik</a>" parameters="loop=1&amp;playlist=pvRqvX413Ik"]</code></p>
