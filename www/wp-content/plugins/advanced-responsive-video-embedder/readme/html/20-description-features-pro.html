<p>This plugin is financed by the awesome buyers of the <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase">Pro Addon</a>. The development and support of this plugins has become a almost full time job for me so I hope you understand that I can not make all features gratis and that you <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase">purchase it</a> to get extra features and support the development.</p>

<h3><a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/#purchase">Pro Addon</a></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Disable links in embeds (killer feature!)</strong><br>
For example: Clicking on a title in a YouTube embed will not open a new popup/tab/window. <strong>Prevent video hosts to lead your visitors away from your site!</strong> Note this also breaks sharing functionality and is not possible when the provider requires flash. Try it on <a href="https://nextgenthemes.com/plugins/advanced-responsive-video-embedder-pro/">this page</a>. Right click on links still works.</li>
<li><strong>Lazyload mode</strong><br>
Make your site load <strong>faster</strong> by loading only a image instead of the entire video player on pageload.  </li>
<li><strong>Lazyload -> Lightbox</strong><br>
Shows the Video in a Lightbox after clicking a preview image</li>
<li><strong>Link -> Lightbox</strong><br>
Use simple links as triggers for lightboxed videos</li>
<li>Automatic or custom thumbnail images</li>
<li>Automatic or custom titles on top of your thumbnails</li>
